* Usage

When the minor-mode =clean-kill-ring-mode= is enabled, any string that
satisfies one of the filter predicates in the =clean-kill-ring-filters= list
variable will not be allowed into the =kill-ring=.

By default =clean-kill-ring-filters= only contains the predicate
=string-blank-p=, which means that no blank lines will be allowed into the
=kill-ring=.

If the variable =clean-kill-ring-prevent-duplicates= is set to a non-nil value
then upon killing text that already exists in =kill-ring=, the old duplicate
entries will be removed.

To manually clean the =kill-ring=, call the interactive function
=clean-kill-ring-clean=.
